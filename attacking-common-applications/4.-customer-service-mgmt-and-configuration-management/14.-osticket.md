## 1. Credential Dumping with Dehashed

Use Dehashed to find leaked credentials for company employees:

```bash
sudo python3 dehashed.py -q inlanefreight.local -pid : 5996447501
```

**Note:** Requires a valid Dehashed API key.

## 2. Subdomain Enumeration

Identify additional attack surfaces like VPN portals, internal tools, or exposed services:

```bash
cat ilfreight_subdomains
```

**Tools to use:** sublist3r, amass, assetfinder, etc.

## 3. osTicket Enumeration

### Identifying osTicket Instances:

- Run **EyeWitness** to capture web application screenshots.
    
- Look for cookies like `OSTSESSID`, indicating an osTicket session.
    
- Check the page footer for mentions of "powered by osTicket" or "Support Ticket System."
    

### Creating a Ticket (to obtain email addresses):

1. Open the osTicket web portal.
    
2. Submit a new support ticket.
    
3. Note the **assigned internal email address** (e.g., `940288@inlanefreight.local`).
    
4. Use this email to register for other company services (Slack, GitLab, etc.).
    

## 4. Credential Testing

- **Manually test** leaked credentials on the osTicket portal and other discovered services.
    
- **Check support tickets** for sensitive information like:
    
    - Password reset details.
        
    - Internal system configurations.
        
    - Employee email addresses and usernames.
        

## 5. Exploiting osTicket Vulnerabilities

### Searching for Known Exploits:

Check **Exploit-DB** for vulnerabilities in osTicket versions:

- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**
    
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
    
- **File Upload Exploits**
    
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    

### Example - CVE-2020-24881 (SSRF in osTicket v1.14.1)

- This vulnerability can be used for **internal port scanning** or accessing internal resources.
    

## 6. Social Engineering Tactics

- **Contact support staff** with fabricated technical issues to gather information.
    
- **Ask naive questions** to elicit details about internal processes and systems.
    

## 7. Prevention & Mitigation

### Reducing Exposure:

- Minimize the number of externally exposed applications.
    
- Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on all external portals.
    
- Educate employees on **social engineering threats** and phishing attempts.
    
- Implement **strong password policies** and enforce periodic password changes.
    

## Key Takeaways

- osTicket systems can leak valuable internal information.
    
- Social engineering is an effective method to extract sensitive data.
    
- Credential reuse poses a significant security risk.
    
- Strong security practices are crucial to mitigating these risks.
