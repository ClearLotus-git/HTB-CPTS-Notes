**Initial Enumeration:**

- **OS/Version:** Determine the OS version (e.g., Windows 10, Server 2016) and patch level for potential exploits.
- **Running Services:** Identify services running as SYSTEM or administrator, as they may be vulnerable.
- **Environment Variables:** Examine the PATH variable for writable directories and other useful information.
- **System Information (systeminfo):** Check for recent patches, system boot time, and installed hotfixes.
- **Installed Programs (wmic/PowerShell):** Identify vulnerable applications.
- **Network Connections (netstat):** Find open ports and listening services, especially on localhost.
- **User/Group Information (whoami, net user, net localgroup):** Identify privileged users and groups.
- **Password Policy (net accounts):** Understand password complexity and lockout policies.
- **PowerShell is very useful:** Many of the standard commands have more powerful PowerShell equivalents.

**Communication with Processes:**

- **Access Tokens:** Understand how access tokens define the security context of processes.
- **Network Services (netstat):** Identify vulnerable services listening on network ports.
- **Named Pipes (pipelist, accesschk):** Enumerate and analyze named pipe permissions for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Loopback connections:** Pay close attention to services listening on the loopback address.
- **SeImpersonatePrivilege:** This is a key privilege to look for, and is used in many privilege escalation attacks.

**Windows Privileges Overview:**

- **Privileges vs. Access Rights:** Understand the difference between privileges (system-wide actions) and access rights (object-specific permissions).
- **Windows Authorization Process:** Recognize the role of SIDs, ACEs, and security descriptors.
- **Key Groups:** Know the privileges associated with groups like Administrators, Backup Operators, and Hyper-V Administrators.
- **User Rights Assignment:** Understand the importance of rights like SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, and SeBackupPrivilege.
- **whoami /priv:** Use this command to list the privileges assigned to the current user.
- **UAC:** Be aware of User Account Control and its impact on privilege management.
- **Privileges can be disabled:** Just because a user has a privilege, does not mean that it is currently active.
- **Event ID 4672:** This event can be used to detect the assignment of special privileges.
