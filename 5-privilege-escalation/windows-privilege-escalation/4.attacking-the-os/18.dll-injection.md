### Windows API Calls (DLL Injection)
```powershell
# Open a handle to the target process
OpenProcess

# Allocate memory in the target process
VirtualAllocEx

# Write data into the allocated memory
WriteProcessMemory

# Retrieve the address of an exported function from a DLL
GetProcAddress

# Create a thread in the target process
CreateRemoteThread

# Load a DLL into the process
LoadLibrary

# Free the loaded DLL
FreeLibrary
```

### Registry (DLL Hijacking)
```powershell
Regedit
```

### Process Monitoring (DLL Hijacking)
```powershell
Process Monitor (procmon)
```


## **Key Concepts:**

- **DLL Injection:**
    - Inserting a DLL into a running process to execute arbitrary code.
    - Used for legitimate purposes (hot patching) and malicious activities.
- **LoadLibrary:**
    - Windows API function for loading DLLs.
    - Can be used for remote DLL injection.
- **Manual Mapping:**
    - Directly mapping DLL sections into a process's memory.
    - Bypasses `LoadLibrary` monitoring.
- **Reflective DLL Injection:**
    - DLL loads itself from memory, minimizing host interaction.
- **DLL Hijacking:**
    - Exploiting the Windows DLL search order to load a malicious DLL.
    - Relies on missing or weakly specified DLL paths.
- **DLL Proxying:**
    - Creating a proxy DLL that loads the original DLL, modifies its functions, and returns the modified result.

**Approach, Commands, Tools, and Techniques:**

1. **LoadLibrary Injection:**
    - `OpenProcess`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `GetProcAddress`, `CreateRemoteThread` (Windows API calls).
2. **Manual Mapping:**
    - Load DLL as raw data, map sections, inject shellcode.
3. **Reflective DLL Injection:**
    - `ReflectiveLoader` function within the DLL.
    - Parses PE headers, resolves imports, relocates DLL.
4. **DLL Hijacking:**
    - Process Explorer, PE Explorer (DLL analysis).
    - Process Monitor (procmon) to monitor file access.
    - Create malicious DLLs.
    - Regedit to modify the SafeDllSearchMode.
5. **DLL Proxying:**
    - Create a proxy DLL that loads the original DLL.
    - Modify the desired function within the proxy DLL.
    - Replace the original DLL with the proxy DLL.

**Commands:**

- Windows API calls: `OpenProcess`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `GetProcAddress`, `CreateRemoteThread`, `LoadLibrary`, `FreeLibrary`.
- Regedit.
- Process Monitor(procmon).

**Tools:**

- Process Explorer.
- PE Explorer.
- Compilers (C).
- Debuggers/Disassemblers.

**Techniques:**

- Creating malicious DLLs.
- Modifying DLL functions.
- Monitoring process activity.
- Reverse engineering.
