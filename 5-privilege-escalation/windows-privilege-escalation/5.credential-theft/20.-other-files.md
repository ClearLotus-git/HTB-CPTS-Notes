### Searching File Contents for String
```powershell
findstr /SI /M "password" *.xml *.ini *.txt
findstr /SI "password" *.xml *.ini *.txt *.config
findstr /SPIN "password" *.*
powershell "Select-String -Path C:\Users\htb-student\Documents\*.txt -Pattern password"
```

### Searching for File Extensions
```powershell
dir /S /B *pass*.txt *pass*.xml *pass*.ini *cred* *vnc* *.config*
where /R C:\ *.config
powershell "Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Include *.rdp, *.config, *.vnc, *.cred -ErrorAction Ignore"
```

### Sticky Notes Database
```powershell
ls C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\
powershell "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process; cd .\PSSQLite\; Import-Module .\PSSQLite.psd1; $db = 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite'; Invoke-SqliteQuery -Database $db -Query 'SELECT Text FROM Note' | Format-Table -Wrap"
strings plum.sqlite-wal
```

## **Key Takeaways:**

- **Diverse File Locations:**
    - Credentials and sensitive data can be hidden in various file types and locations, including configuration files, databases, text documents, and even virtual disk images.
    - Network shares are a prime target, as users often store sensitive data without realizing the access permissions.
- **Tools and Techniques:**
    - **Snaffler:** A valuable tool for crawling network shares and identifying files with specific extensions.
    - **`findstr`:** A command-line utility for searching file contents for specific strings.
    - **PowerShell:** A powerful scripting language for searching files, parsing data, and interacting with the system.
    - **`dir` and `where`:** Command-line utilities for searching for files based on their names and extensions.
    - **DB Browser for SQLite:** A GUI tool for examining SQLite databases, such as the Sticky Notes database.
    - **PSSQLite PowerShell Module:** a powershell module to query sqlite databases.
    - **`strings`:** A command-line utility for extracting printable strings from binary files.
- **Sticky Notes:**
    - The Sticky Notes application stores data in an SQLite database, which can contain valuable information.
    - The `plum.sqlite` file and related files are located in the user's AppData directory.
- **Other Files of Interest:**
    - The provided list highlights various system files and directories that may contain credentials or sensitive information.
    - Log files, configuration files, and registry hives are common targets.
- **Manual vs. Automated Searching:**
    - While enumeration scripts are helpful, understanding how to perform manual searches is essential for thorough penetration testing.
    - Manual searches allow for flexibility and the ability to find information that automated tools may miss.
- **Security Awareness:**
    - The text highlights the importance of user security awareness. Many users are unaware that files they save on network shares can be accessed by others.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Regular Expressions:**
    - For more complex searches, consider using regular expressions with `findstr` or PowerShell's `Select-String` cmdlet.
- **Encoding:**
    - Be aware of different file encodings, as this can affect the ability to search for strings.
- **File Permissions:**
    - Always check file permissions to ensure that you have the necessary access to read and modify files.
- **Environmental Variables:**
    - The use of environmental variables such as %SYSTEMDRIVE% and %WINDIR% is very useful when dealing with various windows systems.
- **Safety:**
    - When dealing with production systems, be very careful when searching for and handling sensitive data.
    - Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any penetration testing activities.
- **Post exploitation:**
    - The files that are mentioned are extremely useful during post exploitation phases of a penetration test.
