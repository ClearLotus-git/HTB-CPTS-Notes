**I. Domain Trusts Overview**

**Definition:** Trusts establish authentication between domains or forests, allowing users to access resources in other domains.

**Types of Trusts:**

- **Parent-child:** Within the same forest, transitive, bidirectional.
- **Cross-link:** Between child domains, transitive.
- **External:** Between separate forests, non-transitive, uses SID filtering.
- **Tree-root:** Between forest root and new tree root, transitive, bidirectional.
- **Forest:** Between forest root domains, transitive.
- **ESAE:** Used for bastion forests.

**Trust Attributes:**

- **Transitive vs. Non-transitive:**
    - Transitive trusts extend trust to trusted objects of the child domain.
    - Non-transitive trusts only trust the child domain itself.
- **One-way vs. Bidirectional:**
    - One-way: Trusted domain users can access resources in the trusting domain.
    - Bidirectional: Users from both domains can access resources in each other.

**II. Enumerating Trust Relationships**

**Get-ADTrust (PowerShell):** Enumerates domain trust relationships using built-in tools.

_Commands:_

```powershell
Import-Module activedirectory
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```

**PowerView (PowerShell):** Provides functions for enumerating trusts, types, and authentication flow.

_Commands:_

```powershell
Get-DomainTrust
Get-DomainTrustMapping
Get-DomainUser -Domain LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL | select SamAccountName
```

**netdom (Command-line):** Retrieves domain information, including trusts, domain controllers, workstations, and servers.

_Commands:_

```cmd
netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local dc
netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
```

**BloodHound:** Visualizes trust relationships using the "Map Domain Trusts" pre-built query.

**III. Key Takeaways**

- Domain trusts can introduce security vulnerabilities if misconfigured.
- Understanding trust types and directions is crucial for assessment.
- Enumeration tools like Get-ADTrust, PowerView, netdom, and BloodHound are essential.
- It is very important to stay within the rules of engagement when testing domain trusts.
- Trusts can be a great way for attackers to "pivot" from one domain to another.
