### Active Directory Attacks: Comprehensive Analysis

Active Directory (AD) is a cornerstone of IT infrastructure, managing authentication, permissions, and access to network resources. Its critical role makes it a prime target for attackers, with a wide array of attack methods documented across various stages of the cyber kill chain. This analysis compiles a comprehensive list of AD attacks, categorized by their objectives, and provides detailed descriptions based on research from multiple sources, including security blogs, MITRE ATT&CK, and technical guides. The current time is 11:00 PM PDT on Monday, March 31, 2025, and all information is aligned with contemporary understanding.
