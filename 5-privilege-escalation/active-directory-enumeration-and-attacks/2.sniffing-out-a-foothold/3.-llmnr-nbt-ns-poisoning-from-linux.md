# Tool Overview

### Responder
- A Python-based tool designed to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS protocols.
- Commonly used on Linux attack hosts, with a .exe version for Windows.
- Supports capturing and relaying authentication requests.

### Inveigh
- A cross-platform MITM tool for spoofing and poisoning attacks.
- Written in C# and PowerShell (PowerShell version is considered legacy).
- Effective for attacking multiple protocols including LLMNR and NBNS.

### Metasploit
- Provides various scanners and spoofing modules for poisoning and relay attacks.

Both Responder and Inveigh can target the following protocols:
- LLMNR, DNS, MDNS, NBNS, DHCP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, Proxy Auth.

Responder additionally supports:
- MSSQL, DCE-RPC, FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP authentication.

# Pre-Attack Network Scanning

### Identify hosts responding to NetBIOS name service
```bash
nmap -Pn --script broadcast-netbios-master-browser
```

### Scan for LLMNR-enabled hosts on the network
```bash
nmap -p 5355 --script llmnr-resolve <target-ip>
```

# Responder Usage Examples

### Display help information for Responder
```bash
responder -h
```

### Run Responder on interface eth0 with SMB and HTTP capture enabled
```bash
responder -I eth0 -w -r -f
```

### Run Responder in analysis mode
```bash
responder -A
```

### Run Responder on a specific interface (eth0)
```bash
responder -I eth0
```

### Run Responder on interface ens224
```bash
responder -I ens224
```

### View captured hashes in Responder logs
```bash
cat /usr/share/responder/logs/Responder-Session.log
```

# Hashcat Usage Examples

### Crack NTLMv2 hashes using Hashcat with RockYou wordlist
```bash
hashcat -m 5600 forend_ntlmv2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Run Hashcat in the background for long processes
```bash
nohup hashcat -m 5600 forend_ntlmv2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt &
```

# Post-Exploitation Considerations

### Use cracked credentials for lateral movement or privilege escalation (example with SMB)
```bash
smbclient -U <username> //<target-ip>/share
```

# Defensive Measures

### Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS to prevent poisoning attacks
- For Windows, use Group Policy Editor to disable these services.
- Ensure SMB signing is enforced to prevent relay attacks.





### **1. LLMNR and NBT-NS Fundamentals:**

- **Purpose:** These are fallback name resolution protocols used by Windows when DNS fails.
- **Vulnerability:** They broadcast name resolution requests on the local network, allowing any host to respond.
- **Protocols and Ports:** LLMNR uses UDP port 5355, while NBT-NS uses UDP port 137.

### **2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**

- **Poisoning:** Attackers use tools like Responder to respond to LLMNR/NBT-NS requests, pretending to be the requested host.
- **Credential Capture:** This tricks victim machines into sending authentication requests (NTLM hashes) to the attacker's machine.
- **Hash Cracking:** Captured NTLM hashes can be cracked offline using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.

### **3. Responder Tool:**

- **Functionality:** A Python-based tool designed to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests.
- **Analysis Mode:** Responder can be used in analysis mode to passively monitor network traffic.
- **WPAD Proxy:** Responder can start a rogue WPAD proxy server to capture HTTP requests.
- **Log Files:** Captured hashes are stored in log files and a SQLite database.
- **Port Requirements:** Responder requires access to specific network ports to function correctly.

### **4. Attack Flow:**

- A victim machine attempts to resolve a hostname that doesn't exist in DNS.
- The machine broadcasts an LLMNR/NBT-NS request.
- Responder intercepts the request and sends a spoofed response.
- The victim machine sends its credentials (NTLM hash) to Responder.
- The attacker cracks the hash to obtain the cleartext password.

### **5. NTLM Hashes:**

- **NTLMv1 and NTLMv2:** These are authentication protocols that use LM or NT hashes.
- **Offline Cracking:** NTLM hashes can be cracked offline using tools like Hashcat.
- **SMB Relay:** Captured hashes can sometimes be used in SMB relay attacks.

### **6. Tools and Techniques:**

- **Responder:** Primary tool for LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning.
- **Hashcat:** Tool for cracking captured NTLM hashes.
- **Wordlists:** Used in conjunction with Hashcat to crack passwords.
- **Inveigh and Metasploit:** Alternative tools for performing poisoning attacks.

### **7. Security Implications:**

- **Vulnerable Protocols:** LLMNR and NBT-NS are inherently vulnerable to MitM attacks.
- **Credential Theft:** Successful poisoning attacks can lead to the theft of user credentials.
- **Lateral Movement:** Compromised credentials can be used to gain access to other systems on the network.
- **Mitigation:** Practices like SMB signing and disabling unneeded services can help mitigate this attack.
