### Check SUID/SGID Script Permissions
```bash
ls -l <script_name>.py
```

### Check Script Contents
```bash
cat <script_name>.py
```

### Find Library Location
```bash
grep -r "def <function_name>" /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/<library_name>/
```

### Check Library Permissions
```bash
ls -l /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/<library_name>/__init__.py
```

### Modify Library (Insert Malicious Code)
```bash
nano /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/<library_name>/__init__.py
```

### Run Script (With sudo if needed)
```bash
sudo python3 <script_name>.py
```


# **Key Concepts:**

- **Python Libraries:**
    - Modules that extend Python's functionality.
    - Examples: NumPy, Pandas, psutil.
- **Import Mechanism:**
    - Python searches for modules in a specific order.
    - `sys.path` shows the search path.
- **Hijacking Techniques:**
    - Wrong write permissions on library files.
    - Manipulating the library search path.
    - Using the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
- **SUID/SGID:**
    - Scripts with these bits set run with the owner's/group's privileges.

**Attack Vectors and Exploitation:**

1. **Wrong Write Permissions:**
    - If a library file is writable by the attacker, they can modify it.
    - Inject malicious code into the library.
    - If a SUID/SGID script imports the library, the malicious code runs with elevated privileges.
2. **Library Path Manipulation:**
    - Python searches for libraries in a specific order (defined by `sys.path`).
    - If a higher-priority directory is writable, the attacker can place a malicious library there.
    - Python will import the malicious library instead of the legitimate one.
3. **PYTHONPATH Environment Variable:**
    - The `PYTHONPATH` variable allows specifying additional library search paths.
    - If the attacker can control `PYTHONPATH` (e.g., via `sudo`), they can redirect Python to a malicious directory.

**Exploitation Steps (as described):**

1. **Wrong Write Permissions:**
    - Identify a SUID/SGID Python script.
    - Identify the imported library.
    - Check the library's permissions.
    - Modify the library to inject malicious code.
    - Run the script.
2. **Library Path Manipulation:**
    - Identify a Python script that imports a library.
    - Check `sys.path` to determine the library search order.
    - Identify a writable directory with higher priority.
    - Create a malicious library in that directory.
    - Run the script.
3. **PYTHONPATH Environment Variable:**
    - Identify a Python script that imports a library.
    - Check sudo -l to see if you can set environment variables for the python binary.
    - Create a malicious library.
    - Set `PYTHONPATH` to point to the malicious directory.
    - Run the script.

**Important Considerations and Enhancements:**

- **Security Best Practices:**
    - Use proper file permissions.
    - Avoid writable directories in the library search path.
    - Restrict `sudo` access.
    - Do not allow the setting of environment variables via sudo, unless absolutely needed.
- **Attack Scenarios:**
    - Developer environments.
    - Web applications.
    - Automation scripts.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Regularly audit file permissions.
    - Use virtual environments.
    - Use package managers (e.g., `pip`) to install libraries.
    - Use tools like `bandit` to scan python code for vulnerabilities.
- **Detection:**
    - Monitor file system changes.
    - Use intrusion detection systems.
    - Monitor for unexpected Python library imports.
- **Real world examples:** Researching real world python library hijacking exploits will help solidify understanding of the attack vectors.
- **Virtual Environments:** Emphasize the importance of virtual environments for python development.
- **Pip Security:** Emphasize the importance of only installing python packages from trusted sources.
