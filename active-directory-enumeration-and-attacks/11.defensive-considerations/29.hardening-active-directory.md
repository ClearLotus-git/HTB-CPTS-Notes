**I. Hardening Active Directory**

- **Step One: Document and Audit**
    - Annual (or more frequent) audits of:
        - Naming conventions (OUs, computers, users, groups).
        - DNS, network, and DHCP configurations.
        - GPOs and their application.
        - FSMO role assignments.
        - Application inventory.
        - Enterprise host locations.
        - Trust relationships.
        - Users with elevated permissions.
- **People**
    - Strong password policy (including password filters).
    - Periodic password rotation for service accounts.
    - Disallow local administrator access on user workstations.
    - Disable the default RID-500 local admin account.
    - Implement tiered administration.
    - Restrict privileged group memberships.
    - Use the Protected Users group.
    - Disable Kerberos delegation for administrative accounts.
- **Protected Users Group**
    - Provides additional protections against authentication threats.
    - Restrictions:
        - No constrained or unconstrained delegation.
        - No plaintext credential caching (CredSSP, Windows Digest).
        - No NTLM, DES, or RC4 authentication.
        - No caching of long-term keys or plaintext credentials after TGT acquisition.
        - TGT renewal limited to the original 4-hour TTL.
- **Processes**
    - AD asset management policies.
    - Access control policies (provisioning/de-provisioning, MFA).
    - Host provisioning and decommissioning processes (baseline hardening, gold images).
    - AD cleanup policies (stale accounts, records).
    - Legacy OS/service decommissioning processes.
    - Scheduled user, group, and host audits.
- **Technology**
    - Periodic AD reviews for misconfigurations and threats.
    - Use tools like BloodHound, PingCastle, and Grouper.
    - Prevent storing passwords in AD account descriptions.
    - Review SYSVOL for sensitive data.
    - Use gMSAs and MSAs for service accounts.
    - Disable unconstrained delegation.
    - Harden jump hosts for DC access.
    - Set ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota to 0.
    - Disable the print spooler service.
    - Disable NTLM authentication for DCs.
    - Use Extended Protection for Authentication and Require SSL for CA services.
    - Enable SMB and LDAP signing.
    - Take steps to prevent enumeration with tools like BloodHound.
    - Regular penetration tests/AD security assessments.
    - Test backups and review disaster recovery plans.
    - Restrict anonymous access and null session enumeration (RestrictNullSessAccess registry key).

**II. Protections by Section (MITRE ATT&CK)**

- **External Reconnaissance (T1589)**
    - Minimize publicly released information.
    - Scrub documents before release.
- **Internal Reconnaissance (T1595)**
    - Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
    - Use firewalls and NIDS.
    - Implement SIEM.
    - Tune Windows Firewall and EDR to block unwanted traffic (e.g., ICMP).
- **Poisoning (T1557)**
    - Use SMB message signing.
    - Encrypt traffic.
- **Password Spraying (T1110/003)**
    - Enable logging and monitoring (Event IDs 4624, 4648).
    - Implement strong password policies.
    - Use account lockout policies.
    - Implement MFA.
- **Credentialed Enumeration (TA0006)**
    - Monitor for unusual activity (CLI usage, RDP, file movement).
    - Use network heuristics and segmentation.
- **Living Off the Land (LOTL)**
    - Establish network traffic and user behavior baselines.
    - Monitor command shells.
    - Implement AppLocker policies.
- **Kerberoasting (T1558/003)**
    - Use strong encryption (not RC4).
    - Enforce strong password policies.
    - Use gMSAs.
    - Periodically audit user account permissions.

**III. MITRE ATT&CK Breakdown**

- Explains the structure of the MITRE ATT&CK framework (Tactics, Techniques, Sub-techniques).
- Provides an example using Kerberoasting (TA0006/T1558.003).

**IV. Key Takeaways**

- A layered approach to AD hardening is essential.
- Understanding and implementing best practices for People, Processes, and Technology is crucial.
- Regular audits and assessments are necessary.
- The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides valuable insights into attack techniques and mitigations.
- Having a strong baseline security posture is more important than just buying more security tools.
