## 1. Overview

- **Definition:** Thick client applications in a three-tier architecture communicate with a server for database access.
    
- **Common Security Risks:**
    
    - Path traversal vulnerabilities.
        
    - SQL injection.
        
    - Unencrypted data transmission.
        
    - Hardcoded credentials.
        
    - Weak authentication mechanisms.
        
- **Key Attack Vectors:**
    
    - Client-side code analysis.
        
    - Network traffic interception.
        
    - Exploiting insecure server-side logic.

## 2. Penetration Testing Steps

### Initial Enumeration

- **Goal:** Gather details about application architecture, communication protocols, and server-side technologies.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Identify file types, configuration files, and logs.
        
    - Determine server OS, database type, and programming language.
        
    - Look for JAR, XML, and configuration files (e.g., `fatty-client.jar`, `beans.xml`).
        

### Network Traffic Analysis

- **Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities in client-server communication.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Capture and inspect traffic between the client and server.
        
    - Extract API endpoints, authentication tokens, and sensitive data.
        
- **Commands:**
    

```bash
# Capture network traffic
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

# Filter HTTP traffic
sudo tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e http.request.uri
```

- **Tools:** Wireshark, tcpdump, Burp Suite, MitMProxy
    

### Client-Side Code Analysis

- **Goal:** Reverse engineer application logic to identify potential exploits.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Extract and analyze JAR files.
        
    - Identify vulnerable file path handling and SQL query construction.
        
- **Commands:**
    

```bash
# Extract a JAR file
jar -xvf fatty-client.jar

# Decompile Java classes
jd-gui fatty-client.jar
```

- **Tools:** JD-GUI, JADX, dnSpy, Ghidra
    

### Path Traversal Exploitation

- **Goal:** Exploit improper file path handling.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Inject path traversal sequences to access unauthorized files.
        
    - Modify client-side code to bypass validation.
        
- **Example Payloads:**
    

```bash
../../../etc/passwd
../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
```

### SQL Injection

- **Goal:** Manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Analyze SQL queries in client-side code.
        
    - Inject malicious SQL statements.
        
- **Example Payloads:**
    

```sql
' OR '1'='1' --  # Bypass authentication
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
'; DROP TABLE users; --  # Dangerous, deletes a table
```

### Reverse Engineering & Debugging

- **Goal:** Extract hidden vulnerabilities and credentials.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Debug runtime behavior.
        
    - Analyze memory for sensitive data.
        
- **Commands:**
    

```bash
# Extract strings from an executable
strings restart-service.exe

# Debug executable
x64dbg restart-service.exe
```

- **Tools:** x64dbg, GDB, IDA Pro, Frida
    

### Host File Manipulation (If Needed)

- **Goal:** Redirect client application requests for controlled testing.
    
- **Commands:**
    

```bash
# Modify hosts file (Linux/macOS)
echo "192.168.1.100 server.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Modify hosts file (Windows)
echo 192.168.1.100 server.local >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

## 3. Key Takeaways

- **Client-side code can expose sensitive information.**
    
- **Intercepted network traffic can reveal authentication mechanisms.**
    
- **Path traversal and SQL injection remain critical threats in web-based thick clients.**
    
- **Reverse engineering helps uncover hidden vulnerabilities.**
    
- **MitM attacks can reveal unencrypted credentials.**

## 4. Important Notes

- **Ethical Testing:** Ensure explicit permission before testing.
    
- **Modify file paths and usernames to fit your environment.**
    
- **Some tests require administrative privileges.**
    
- **Ensure all necessary tools are installed before testing.**

## 5. Mitigation Strategies

- **Input Validation:** Properly sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
    
- **Use Secure Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms.
    
- **Encrypt Data Transmission:** Use TLS to secure communication.
    
- **Regular Patching:** Keep application dependencies and frameworks updated.
    
- **Code Obfuscation:** Make reverse engineering more difficult.
