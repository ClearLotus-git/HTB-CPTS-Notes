## 3. Application-Specific Hardening Tips

### WordPress:

- Use security plugins like WordFence for monitoring and protection.
    

### Joomla:

- Use plugins like AdminExile to require a secret key for admin login.
    

### Drupal:

- Disable, hide, or move the admin login page.
    

### Tomcat:

- Limit access to Tomcat Manager and Host-Manager to localhost.
    
- Enforce IP whitelisting for external access.
    

### Jenkins:

- Configure permissions using the Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin.
    

### Splunk:

- Change the default password.
    
- Ensure proper licensing for authentication enforcement.
    

### PRTG Network Monitor:

- Change the default password.
    
- Keep the application up to date.
    

### osTicket:

- Limit internet access.
    

### GitLab:

- Enforce sign-up restrictions and domain restrictions.
    

## 4. Continuous Improvement

### Regular Inventory Updates:

- Maintain an up-to-date application inventory.
    

### Regular Assessments:

- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests.
    

### Remediation:

- Implement remediation recommendations from assessments.
    

### Security Awareness:

- Promote a security-conscious mindset within the organization.
    

## 5. Secure Configuration Management

### Configuration Files:

- Securely store and manage configuration files.
    
- Avoid storing sensitive information (credentials, API keys) in plain text.
    
- Implement access controls for configuration files.
    

### Environment Variables:

- Use environment variables for sensitive data.
    
- Ensure proper isolation of environment variables.
    

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

- If applicable, use IaC tools to manage infrastructure configurations.
    
- Implement version control and code reviews for IaC configurations.
    

## 6. Input Validation and Output Encoding

### Input Validation:

- Validate all user-supplied input to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    
- Use whitelisting whenever possible.
    
- Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially malicious characters.
    

### Output Encoding:

- Encode output to prevent XSS attacks.
    
- Use context-aware encoding.
    

## 7. Session Management

### Secure Session IDs:

- Generate strong, random session IDs.
    
- Protect session IDs from disclosure.
    

### Session Timeouts:

- Implement appropriate session timeouts.
    

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):

- Enforce HTTPS connections.
    

### Secure Cookies:

- Use the Secure and HttpOnly flags for cookies.
    

## 8. Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling:

- Avoid displaying sensitive information in error messages.
    
- Implement custom error pages.
    

### Logging:

- Enable comprehensive logging.
    
- Log security-related events.
    
- Securely store and manage log files.
    
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
    

## 9. Dependency Management

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA):

- Use SCA tools to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
    
- Keep dependencies up-to-date.
    

### Supply Chain Security:

- Ensure that any external software that is being used comes from a trusted source.
    

## 10. Database Security

### Principle of Least Privilege:

- Grant database users only the necessary privileges.
    

### Input Validation:

- Validate all input to database queries.
    

### Stored Procedures:

- Use stored procedures to minimize direct SQL queries.
    

### Database Encryption:

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    

## 11. Network Security

### Firewall Rules:

- Implement strict firewall rules.
    
- Limit network access to applications.
    

### Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):

- Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and prevent malicious network activity.
    

### Network Segmentation:

- Segment the network to isolate sensitive applications.
    

## 12. Security Awareness Training
