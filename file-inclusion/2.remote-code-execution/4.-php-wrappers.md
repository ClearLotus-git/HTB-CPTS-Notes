**Key Takeaways:**

- **From LFI to RCE:**
    - The section transitions from reading local files to executing commands.
    - Enumerating credentials and SSH keys is mentioned, but the focus is on direct RCE.
- **PHP Wrappers for RCE:**
    - `data://`, `input://`, and `expect://` wrappers are covered.
    - `allow_url_include` setting is crucial for `data://` and `input://`.
- **Checking PHP Configurations:**
    - Reading `php.ini` to check `allow_url_include` and `expect` status.
    - Using `base64` encoding and decoding for `php.ini` content.
    - Using grep to find the needed configuration values.
- **`data://` Wrapper:**
    - Allows including external data, including PHP code.
    - Requires `allow_url_include` to be enabled.
    - Base64 encoding is used to pass PHP code.
    - Example: `data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8+Cg==`
- **`input://` Wrapper:**
    - Includes external input from POST requests.
    - Requires `allow_url_include` to be enabled.
    - PHP code is passed as POST data.
    - Commands are passed as GET parameters.
    - Demonstrates how to use curl to send post data.
- **`expect://` Wrapper:**
    - Allows direct command execution.
    - Requires the `expect` extension to be installed and enabled.
    - Example: `expect://id`
    - Very simple syntax.
- **Further Exploitation:**
    - Mention of `phar://` and `zip://` wrappers for file upload scenarios.
    - Reinforces that this is not the only way to gain RCE.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **`allow_url_include` Importance:**
    - This setting is a major security risk when enabled.
    - It should be disabled in production environments.
- **`expect` Extension Security:**
    - The `expect` extension can also be a security risk.
    - It should be used with caution.
- **Real-World Scenarios:**
    - Attackers often combine these techniques with other vulnerabilities.
    - WAFs and other security measures can hinder these attacks.
- **Defense in Depth:**
    - Proper input validation and sanitization are crucial.
    - Principle of least privilege should be followed.
    - Keep php updated.
- **Error Messages:**
    - As with all web attacks, error messages can give an attacker valuable information. Proper error handling is very important.
- **Curl usage:**
    - The examples provided, show very good usage of the curl command line tool. This is a very useful tool for web penetration testing.
