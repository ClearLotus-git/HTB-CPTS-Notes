# **Key Hardening Practices:**

1. **Updates and Patching:**
    - Importance: Addresses known vulnerabilities.
    - Tools: `unattended-upgrades` (Debian/Ubuntu), `yum-cron` (Red Hat).
    - Best Practices: Automate updates, prioritize security patches.
2. **Configuration Management:**
    - Importance: Secures system settings.
    - Practices:
        - Audit file permissions (SUID, writable).
        - Use absolute paths in cron and sudo.
        - Secure credentials.
        - Clean up user directories and bash history.
        - Secure custom libraries.
        - Remove unnecessary packages/services.
        - Implement SELinux (or AppArmor).
3. **User Management:**
    - Importance: Controls user access.
    - Practices:
        - Limit user and admin accounts.
        - Log and monitor logon attempts.
        - Enforce strong password policies.
        - Restrict group memberships.
        - Implement the principle of least privilege for sudo.
4. **Audit:**
    - Importance: Regularly assess security posture.
    - Practices:
        - Perform security and configuration checks.
        - Use security baselines (DISA STIGs).
        - Follow compliance frameworks (ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
        - Use auditing tools (Lynis).
5. **Automation:**
    - Importance: Improves efficiency and consistency.
    - Tools: Puppet, SaltStack, Zabbix, Nagios.
    - Practices:
        - Automate configuration checks and remediation.
        - Use checksum verification for sensitive binaries.

**Lynis Auditing Tool:**

- Purpose: Performs security audits and provides hardening tips.
- Usage: `./lynis audit system`.
- Features:
    - Warnings and suggestions.
    - Hardening index.
    - Detailed scan report.
- Importance: Provides a good base line security audit.

**Key Enhancements and Considerations:**

- **Security Baselines:** Emphasize the importance of using established security benchmarks.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Reinforce the importance of granting only necessary permissions.
- **Log Monitoring:** Stress the importance of centralized log monitoring for detecting suspicious activity.
- **File Integrity Monitoring:** Highlight the value of tools that detect unauthorized file changes.
- **Automation Security:** Be aware of the security risks that come with automation. If automation tools are not secured properly, they can become an attack vector.
- **Regular Penetration Testing:** Emphasize that audits are not a replacement for regular penetration testing.
- **Container Security:** More information could be given about how to harden containers.
- **Kernel Hardening:** More information could be given about kernel hardening best practices.
- **Network Hardening:** More information could be given about network hardening best practices.
- **Security awareness training:** Emphasize the importance of security awareness training for all users.
