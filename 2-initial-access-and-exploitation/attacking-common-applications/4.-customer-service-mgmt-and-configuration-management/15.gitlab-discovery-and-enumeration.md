## 1. Discovery

### Web Browser:

- Visiting the GitLab URL directly will usually display the GitLab login page, revealing its presence.
    

## 2. Enumeration

### Version Enumeration:

- The GitLab version is typically found on the `/help` page, but it requires authentication.
    
- If registration is disabled, low-risk exploits might be attempted, but this is generally discouraged without explicit permission.
    

### Public Projects (`/explore`):

- Visit the `/explore` page to find public projects.
    
- These projects may contain:
    
    - API interaction scripts.
        
    - Configuration files with secrets.
        
    - SSH private keys.
        
    - Source code for vulnerability analysis.
        

### Registration (`/users/sign_up`):

- Attempt to register an account.
    
- If successful, gain access to potentially more internal projects.
    
- Use the registration form to enumerate valid usernames and email addresses.
    
    - Trying to register an account with an existing email will produce the error "Email has already been taken".
        
    - Trying to register an account with an existing username will produce the error "Username has already been taken".
        

### Credential Testing (OSINT):

- If credentials are obtained from OSINT (e.g., Dehashed), attempt to log in.
    

### Internal Projects:

- Once logged in, check the `/explore` page again for internal projects that are now available.
    
- Review the source code of internal projects for sensitive information.
    

### Search Functionality:

- Use the search function within GitLab to look for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and usernames.
    

### Groups and Snippets:

- Explore the "groups" and "snippets" sections for potentially valuable information.
    

## 3. Security Considerations

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

- GitLab's 2FA is disabled by default, creating a security risk.
    

### Fail2Ban:

- Implement Fail2Ban to block brute-force login attempts.
    

### IP Restrictions:

- Restrict GitLab access to specific IP addresses if it must be externally accessible.
    

### Account Registration:

- Restrict account registration to company email addresses and require administrative approval.
    

## Key Takeaways

- GitLab repositories can contain sensitive information.
    
- Enumerating user accounts and email addresses is possible through the registration process.
    
- Public projects and internal repositories are valuable sources of information.
    
- Proper security configurations are crucial to protect GitLab instances.
