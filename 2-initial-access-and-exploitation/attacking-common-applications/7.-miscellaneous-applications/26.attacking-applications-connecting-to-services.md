## 1. ELF Executable Analysis (octopus_checker)

### **Overview**

- The `octopus_checker` binary attempts to connect to a database.
    
- It likely contains a SQL connection string with credentials.
    

### **Tools Used**

- GDB (GNU Debugger)
    
- PEDA (Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB)
    

### **Steps to Analyze ELF Binary**

1. Run the binary in GDB.
    
2. Disassemble the main function to find SQL connection string components.
    
3. Identify the `SQLDriverConnect` call.
    
4. Set a breakpoint at the `SQLDriverConnect` call.
    
5. Run the program and examine the register values (specifically `RDX`) to find the connection string.
    

### **GDB Commands**

```sh
# Start debugging the ELF executable
gdb ./octopus_checker

# Set disassembly flavor to Intel syntax
set disassembly-flavor intel

# Disassemble the main function
disas main

# Set breakpoint at the identified address
b *0x<address>

# Run the program
run
```

## 2. DLL File Analysis (MultimasterAPI.dll)

### **Overview**

- `MultimasterAPI.dll` is a .NET assembly.
    
- It may contain connection strings or credentials.
    

### **Tools Used**

- Get-FileMetaData (PowerShell)
    
- dnSpy (.NET assembly editor/debugger)
    

### **Steps to Analyze DLL File**

1. Use `Get-FileMetaData` to extract metadata and potential strings.
    
2. Use `dnSpy` to decompile and examine the DLL's source code.
    
3. Inspect relevant classes (e.g., `MultimasterAPI.Controllers -> ColleagueController`) for connection strings.
    

### **PowerShell Command**

```sh
# Extract metadata from DLL
Get-FileMetaData .\MultimasterAPI.dll
```

## 3. General Attack Considerations

### **1. Password Reusability**

- Check if extracted passwords are reused on other services.
    

### **2. Password Spraying**

- Use extracted usernames and common passwords to test other services.

## 4. Key Concepts

- **Connection Strings:** Strings that contain information needed to connect to a database or service.
    
- **ELF Executables:** Executable and Linkable Format, a common format for executable files on Linux systems.
    
- **DLL Files:** Dynamic Link Libraries, files containing code and data that can be used by multiple programs on Windows systems.
    
- **GDB:** GNU Debugger, a powerful tool for debugging programs.
    
- **dnSpy:** A .NET assembly editor and debugger.
    
- **PEDA:** Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB.

## 5. Important Notes

- Always perform these actions on systems you have explicit permission to test.
    
- Be aware of legal and ethical considerations.
    
- Use extracted credentials responsibly.
