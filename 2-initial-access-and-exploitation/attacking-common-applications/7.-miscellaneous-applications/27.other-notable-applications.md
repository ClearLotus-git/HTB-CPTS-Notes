## **1. Methodology over Specific Tools**

- The core focus is on teaching a methodology that can be applied to various applications, not just the ones explicitly covered.
    

## **2. Comprehensive Enumeration**

- Thorough network enumeration and application discovery are crucial for identifying potential attack vectors.
    
- Tools like **EyeWitness** create visual representations of web applications and help identify multiple systems.
    

## **3. Adaptability and Persistence**

- Penetration testers must be adaptable and persistent, as they will encounter many unknown applications.
    
- Digging through scan data and filtering out noise can reveal hidden vulnerabilities.
    

## **4. Abuse of Built-in Functionality**

- Many applications have built-in features that can be abused for malicious purposes.
    
- Default credentials remain a common vulnerability.
    

## **5. Understanding Application Logic**

- Understanding how an application works is essential to discovering vulnerabilities.

## **Notable Applications and Vulnerabilities**

### **1. Axis2**

- Similar to Tomcat, it can be vulnerable to weak/default credentials.
    
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) can be achieved by uploading a webshell as an AAR file.
    

### **2. WebSphere**

- Historically vulnerable to various exploits.
    
- Default credentials (`system:manager`) can lead to RCE via WAR file deployment.
    

### **3. Elasticsearch**

- Known for past vulnerabilities.
    
- Older, forgotten installations can still be vulnerable.
    

### **4. Zabbix**

- Vulnerable to SQL injection, authentication bypass, XSS, LDAP password disclosure, and RCE.
    
- Its API can also be abused for RCE.
    

### **5. Nagios**

- Vulnerable to RCE, privilege escalation, SQL injection, code injection, and XSS.
    
- Default credentials (`nagiosadmin:PASSW0RD`) are common.
    

### **6. WebLogic**

- Java EE application server with numerous CVEs, including unauthenticated RCE exploits.
    

### **7. Wikis/Intranets (MediaWiki, SharePoint, etc.)**

- Vulnerable to known exploits and document repository issues.
    
- Search functionalities can lead to credential disclosure.
    

### **8. DotNetNuke (DNN)**

- Vulnerable to authentication bypass, directory traversal, XSS, file upload bypass, and arbitrary file download.
    

### **9. vCenter**

- Used to manage ESXi instances.
    
- Vulnerable to weak credentials and exploits like Apache Struts 2 RCE and OVA file upload vulnerabilities.
    
- Windows vCenter appliances are vulnerable to privilege escalation.
