### Key Takeaways: Local File Inclusion (LFI) Attacks

### Basic LFI

- Exploits a parameter that directly includes a file.
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Directly includes a file based on user input
    include($_GET['language']);
    ```
    
    - Allows reading local files by manipulating the parameter.

### Path Traversal

- Bypasses directory restrictions using relative paths (`../`).
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Uses relative path traversal to escape intended directory
    include("./languages/" . $_GET['language']);
    ```
    
    - Enables escaping the intended directory to access other files.

### Filename Prefix Handling

- Some applications prepend a prefix to included filenames.
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Bypassing filename prefix by treating it as a directory
    include("lang_" . $_GET['language']);
    ```
    
    - Can be bypassed by using `/` to treat the prefix as a directory.

### Appended Extensions Bypass

- Some implementations append extensions like `.php`.
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Bypassing appended extensions
    include($_GET['language'] . ".php");
    ```
    
    - Common bypasses include **null byte injections** and **PHP wrappers** (discussed below).

### Second-Order LFI

- Occurs when LFI is exploited through indirect user input (e.g., database entries).
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Injecting LFI payload via user-controlled database input
    $username = getUsernameFromDB($_GET['id']);
    include($username);
    ```
    
    - Highlights the importance of sanitizing all user-controlled data.

### Platform Agnostic Nature

- LFI techniques apply across various backend languages and frameworks.

### Additional Considerations

### Null Byte Injection (Older PHP)

- In older PHP versions, appending a null byte (`%00`) could truncate the filename and bypass appended extensions.
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Exploiting null byte injection to bypass extension appending
    include("/etc/passwd%00");
    ```
    
    - This is less effective in modern PHP versions.

### PHP Wrappers and Filters

- PHP wrappers like `php://filter` allow encoding/decoding files, enabling attackers to read source code even if itâ€™s executed.
- **Example:**
    
    ```php
    ### Using PHP wrappers to read source code
    include("php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php");
    ```
    

### Log File Poisoning

- Attackers can inject data into log files and later include those logs using LFI to execute arbitrary code.
- Often used for achieving **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

### Error Handling

- Detailed error messages should be disabled in production environments.
- Attackers can leverage errors to map the server's file structure.

### Input Sanitization

- Proper validation and sanitization of user input prevent LFI vulnerabilities.
- Whitelisting allowed characters and file paths is a best practice.

### Security Headers

- While not a direct mitigation, security headers add an additional layer of defense against exploitation.
