```powershell
takeown /F C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe

sc.exe start MozillaMaintenance

```



## **Key Points:**

- **Virtualization Access:**
    - Members of [`Hyper-V Administrators`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#hyper-v-administrators) have full control over virtual machines.
    - This allows them to clone Domain Controllers and extract NTDS.dit files.
- **.vhdx File Deletion and Hard Links:**
    - When a .vhdx file is deleted, `vmms.exe` attempts to restore permissions as SYSTEM.
    - This can be abused to create hard links to protected files.
    - This is based on CVE-2018-0952 or CVE-2019-0841, or an application that installs a service that runs as system.
- **Mozilla Maintenance Service Example:**
    - The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be targeted for this exploit.
    - A PowerShell script can be used to grant full control over the `maintenanceservice.exe` file.
    - The file can then be replaced with a malicious executable.
    - Starting the service results in SYSTEM-level command execution.
- **Mitigation:**
    - The hard-link exploit has been mitigated by the March 2020 Windows security updates.

**Approach, Commands, Tools, and Techniques:**

**1. Virtualization Access:**

- **Technique:**
    - Clone virtualized Domain Controllers.
    - Mount virtual disks offline.
    - Extract NTDS.dit files.
- **Tools:**
    - Hyper-V Manager.
    - Virtual Disk tools.
- **Outcome:**
    - Domain wide credential access.

**2. Hard-Link Exploit:**

- **Technique:**
    - Delete a .vhdx file.
    - Create a hard link to a protected file (e.g., `maintenanceservice.exe`).
    - Replace the linked file with a malicious executable.
    - Start the associated service.
- **Tools:**
    - PowerShell (for hard-link creation).
    - `takeown` (for file ownership).
    - `sc.exe` (for service management).
- **Commands:**
    - `takeown /F C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe`
    - `sc.exe start MozillaMaintenance`
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell script to create the hard link and modify file permissions.
- **Outcome:**
    - SYSTEM level command execution.

**3. Considerations:**

- **Vulnerability:**
    - The hard-link exploit relies on specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0952, CVE-2019-0841) or vulnerable services.
    - The core hard link exploit is patched as of March 2020.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Keep systems patched.
    - Implement least privilege for Hyper-V administrators.
    - Monitor for unauthorized virtual machine operations.
- **Virtualization Security:**
    - Treat virtualized Domain Controllers with the same security as physical ones.
    - Segregate virtualization administration.
