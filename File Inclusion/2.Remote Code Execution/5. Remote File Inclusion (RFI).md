**Key Takeaways:**

- **RFI vs. LFI:**
    - RFI allows including remote files, while LFI includes local files.
    - RFI often implies LFI, but not vice versa.
    - RFI enables SSRF and remote code execution.
- **Vulnerable Functions:**
    - Functions like `include()`, `file_get_contents()`, and others can be vulnerable.
    - The table provided is a good reference.
- **Verification of RFI:**
    - Checking `allow_url_include` in PHP is a start.
    - Testing with a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1`) is crucial.
    - Testing to see if the included file is executed, or just displayed is also very important.
- **Remote Code Execution:**
    - Creating a malicious script (e.g., a PHP web shell).
    - Hosting the script on a remote server.
    - Including the script through the RFI vulnerability.
- **Hosting Methods:**
    - **HTTP:**
        - Using Python's `http.server` module.
        - Common and straightforward.
    - **FTP:**
        - Using Python's `pyftpdlib`.
        - Useful for bypassing certain firewalls or WAFs.
        - Authentication within the URL is covered.
    - **SMB:**
        - Using Impacket's `smbserver.py`.
        - Specifically for Windows servers.
        - Utilizing UNC paths.
        - Important to note that this is more reliable on internal networks.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Security Implications:**
    - RFI is a severe vulnerability that can lead to complete server compromise.
    - Disabling remote URL inclusion is a critical security measure.
- **WAF Bypasses:**
    - Attackers may use encoding, obfuscation, or different protocols to bypass WAFs.
    - It is very important to test many different protocols.
- **SSRF Exploitation:**
    - RFI can be combined with SSRF to access internal services and resources.
    - The referenced Server-Side Attacks module is important.
- **Real-World Scenarios:**
    - Attackers often combine RFI with other vulnerabilities for greater impact.
    - Attackers will often use reverse shells instead of simple web shells.
- **Defense in Depth:**
    - Proper input validation and sanitization are essential.
    - Network segmentation and firewalls can limit the impact of RFI.
    - Keeping software up to date is very important.
- **Protocol Diversity:**
    - The demonstration of HTTP, FTP, and SMB highlights the importance of understanding various protocols.
    - Attackers may use less common protocols to evade detection.
